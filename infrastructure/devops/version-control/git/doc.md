Tags
O repositório obrigatoriamente deve possuir uma tag contendo do APPID da aplicação. Na imagem abaixo podemos verificar a tag da aplicação no about do repo.

Outras tags denotando qual a área de negócio ou até contexto da aplicação são muito bem vindas, visto que facilitam encontrar o repositório em pesquisas.
