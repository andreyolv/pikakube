# Kubernetes Audit Logs for Enhanced Visibility and Compliance
## Problem:
- Lack of Visibility and Traceability: In Kubernetes environments, tracking user activity, API interactions, and security-relevant events is critical. Without audit logs, itâ€™s challenging to investigate incidents, ensure compliance, or maintain visibility into cluster activity.
- Compliance Requirements: Many organizations must adhere to regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2) that require audit trails of system activity. Kubernetes does not enable audit logging by default, leaving a gap in observability and accountability.

## Solution:
- Enabling Kubernetes Audit Logging: Activated Kubernetes audit logging by configuring the audit-policy.yaml to capture specific events, including authentication attempts, resource modifications, and access to sensitive objects.
- Centralized Log Storage: Configured the audit logs to be streamed to a centralized and persistent location, such as a secure volume, Fluent Bit pipeline, or log aggregator (e.g., Elasticsearch, Loki), ensuring long-term retention and easy searchability.
- Granular Event Filtering: Defined fine-grained audit policies to capture high-value events (e.g., changes to roles, secrets, and deployments) while minimizing noise, allowing for efficient monitoring and investigation.
- Integration with SIEM and Monitoring Tools: Forwarded audit logs to a SIEM platform to enable alerting, correlation, and dashboard visualization, improving threat detection and forensic capabilities.
- Security and Governance: Established a governance baseline by maintaining a verifiable audit trail of all cluster-level activities. This enhances accountability, supports incident response, and ensures alignment with security best practices and compliance mandates.
