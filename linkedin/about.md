DataOps, Data Platform & Data Reliability Tech Lead with deep expertise in Kubernetes-centric data platforms, leading the design, scaling, reliability, governance, observability, security, and cost-efficiency of complex data ecosystems. I drive technical direction, architect end-to-end data infrastructure, and ensure engineering excellence, platform consistency, and operational maturity.

I specialize in distributed processing, orchestration, cloud-native automation, and FinOps, combining tools such as Airflow (+1000 DAGs), Spark, Kafka, dbt, Kubernetes, FluxCD, Crossplane/Terraform, Azure cloud services, and strong Python/Go engineering to build robust, automated, self-service data platforms.

I lead large-scale platform initiatives across Data Engineering, DataOps, Cloud, Network, Security, Observability, SRE and Governance, orchestrating cross-functional collaboration with data engineers, scientists, architects, and infra teams. My work accelerates development velocity, enforces best practices, reduces operational overhead, and significantly enhances security, compliance, reliability, and cost efficiency.

I’ve built platform-wide automation, including GitOps ecosystems, custom Kubernetes operators, self-service portals, secret-injection frameworks, topic governance platforms, and full observability stacks. I design and enforce SLOs/SLIs, incident response processes, CI/CD standards, supply chain security, and organizational policies that elevate engineering quality at scale.

My leadership is hands-on, pragmatic, and focused on creating highly reliable, scalable, secure, cost-optimized, and developer-friendly data platforms that empower teams and accelerate business value.
